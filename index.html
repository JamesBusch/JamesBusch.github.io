      <p class="mb-4">Under Dr. Gillis I worked on a team of 4 (myself included) to create an Agent Based Model to simulate the spread of COVID-19 in Guelph. Although our team was never given specifics on what part of the project we would be working on, we decided I would work on the backend as I was familiar with C and we were going to write this project in C++. The majority of my work was planning how all the objects would fit together to create the full simulation. This consisted of figuring out what would be needed in an Agent Based Model, drawing a rough UML diagram, then finally assigning each object to a person to code, as well as providing information on the given functions that each object needed.</p>

        <p>Our workdays generally involved of two standing scrum meetings. With the first occurring at the beginning of the workday allowing the team to discuss what they hoped to accomplish that day. The second scrum meeting served as a follow up at the end of the day to discuss what we had completed and what we would need from other members of the team. In general, we had no hard set deadlines but we created some soft dates that we wanted to have things done by, such as front end displaying data, backend moving people around between location, and interfacing the back end with the front end.</p>

       <h2 class="tm-text-color-primary mb-4">My personal work on this project</h2>
       <p class="mb-4">The specific parts of the project I was tasked with were, creating a python script to use the google places API to scrap all data on the surrounding shops, restaurants, parks etc. in Guelph to place into a csv for later use. I then focused on the more algorithm heavy sections of the code. Things like creating a hash table to read in the large amount of location data, determining how and where agents will move, and the chances of agents being infected. For some algorithms Dr. Gillis helped with the formula itself and I implemented it into the code.</p>

     <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Learning Goal One: Learn and implement the best programming paradigm for any given problem</h2>
     <p class="mb-4">The action plan for this was “Review and understand an eABM and determine what paradigm would be best fit for the given agent-based model(IE OOP) Effectively use documentation and collect statistics so it is easier for new people to understand what is going on.”</p>
     <p class="mb-4">I believe we succeeded with this goal. Not only did we pick what is in my opinion the best language for the backend being C++ as we could have both OOP principles and the speed of C. We also constantly updated the documentation and compared all results to real world statistics to make sure what we were doing was accurate. </p>

      <p class="mb-4">Again, we as a team killed this. Every time one of us made any sort of change or update we would test it to make sure to not only test the program ourselves but to get another person on the time to review the PR and make sure that no bugs had arisen. In the end we had a proof of concept that besides an error in a formula causing numbers to go up far too much for infections, the program was bug free.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The action plan for this was “Keep track of all research and development techniques used throughout the term and make diagrams and documents about the software.”</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Again, we as a team killed this. Every time one of us made any sort of change or update we would test it to make sure to not only test the program ourselves but to get another person on the time to review the PR and make sure that no bugs had arisen. In the end we had a proof of concept that besides an error in a formula causing numbers to go up far too much for infections, the program was bug free.Sadly, this was only about half done. While we made diagrams and documentation about this program along with lots of version documenting, code comments, etc., we were unable to write a paper about this program due to how much the scope of this program changed. Initially a paper was planned but we decided to take the program in an opposite direction due to the fact that a lot of number values that were used in calculations were impossible to hard set proven peer reviewed data on, things like the chance of getting infected with COVID-19 in a bar, each age groups (e.g. 10-14) chance of wearing a mask etc. So instead of that we made this program to be used as an education tool! We made every value modular and gave the user full control over what the simulation was meant to do with pre-set value sets if the user didn’t want to edit each value. If you want to simulate a population of people who say things like “this is a plandemic” turn off chances of anyone wearing masks or getting vaccines. If you want to simulate a normal society in which we did nothing to present the spread, you can turn off mask use and social distancing.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">This 8-month placement was phenomenal for me, I learned much more about Git and how to use it in a team environment, C++, and best of all got to write a lot of code and in general I am very happy with how all of this ended up.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Special thanks to Dr. Gillis for swooping in and hiring me at the 11th hour in the middle of a pandemic, if it wasn’t for you, I would have been working a nightshift filling online orders for stores all summer.</p>
